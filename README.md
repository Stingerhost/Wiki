# Stingerhost.eu Community Wiki

Welcome to our community wiki repository. After a brief consideration,
we've decided to open our community wiki. Discord is fine, but let's
be honest, it doesn't provide as much flexibility as a dedicated wiki
site. If you have questions, you can ask at our
[Discord](https://discord.gg/QdCNNTrzww) or contact us via email
or using tickets on our [website](https://stingerhost.eu/).

## Community Contributions

Our wiki is fueled with community contributions. You can write tutorials,
fix spelling, upload screenshots, etc. Contributions are done via pull
requests. Your pull requests are being reviewed. Once your pull request
is approved, it's accepted and merged into the main branch. The history
of the contributions will be visible in the commits tree, alongside with
the person who approved it (merged it into main). Just keep your forks
updated if you want to keep contributing further.

## Contribution Guidelines

Your contributions should follow the principle of a common sense. Obvious
troll contributions will be ignored, contributions that in a core have nothing
to do with anything our hosting services provide are worthless for our customers,
therefore will be ignored. Quality contributions containing easy to understand
content that's in line with our hosting services contents (setting up your game server,
uploading custom game assets, setting up TeamSpeak server, connecting to a server, etc.)
will most likely be accepted. Key factors are the language, completeness, and format.
Spelling doesn't necessarily need to be perfect, so don't worry about a few little mistakes.

## Software

Our wiki is powered by [Wiki.js](https://js.wiki/), and wiki pages are
using Markdown syntax. Refer to [Wiki.js documentation](https://docs.requarks.io/)
for the special formatting options available.

## Locales

Our wiki is written in two languages: English and Czech. Contribution in both languages
is welcomed. If you only know one of them, don't worry, just contribute in your language
of choice (English or Czech), someone might then translate it into the other.
